Supporters are figures placed at the sides of or behind an armorial shield in a manner that makes them appear to support it.

In most countries where supporters are part of the heraldic tradition, their use is limited to those armigers who are granted official authority for their display. When supporters are granted, they are typically authorized in recognition of the armiger's status (e.g., titled nobility) or achievement (e.g. admission to certain orders of chivalry).

The use of assumed supporters is not customary. Using assumed supporters is viewed by most heraldists as a claim to unearned status or achievement. For this reason, even in jurisdictions that do not regulate heraldry, armigers should think very carefully before using assumed supporters.
