<:lion_smile:961787183918882837> **It's a common misconception that each surname has a "family crest".** In actuality, coats of arms only belong to those descended from the original bearer (and more often than not unrelated families have the same last name). In some countries, like <:w_England:693241387713560717> the UK, this is usually limited to direct descendants, and indirect relatives have "differenced" versions of the arms instead, but in others, such as <:w_Germany:672273186645213225> Germany, any direct descendant with the same surname can usually use the arms.

<:lion_tongue:961787184418017310> Some merchandise manufacturers, termed \"bucket shops\", imply otherwise but their claims are misleading. You can look at your family tree to determine whether you legitimately have your 'family crest', especially since in most cases multiple unrelated families share the same surname. As many people don't have inherited arms, we also recommend you look into designing your own, which is a great way to incorporate personal symbolism.

:shield: Also, us heraldists **generally use the term "crest" to refer to a decorative element above the shield**, not the whole device as is said colloquially.
