<:lion_smile:961787183918882837> **It is often misunderstood that elements in heraldry carry predefined meanings,** but the reality is quite the opposite. In heraldry, elements themselves do not possess inherent or universal meanings. Instead, it is the armiger—the individual who bears the coat of arms—who imparts significance to the charges they incorporate.

<:lion_tongue:961787184418017310> While certain elements may have established associations due to cultural contexts, it is important to emphasize that no single element holds a fixed interpretation. The interpretation and symbolism attributed to each element in a coat of arms are subjective and determined by the armiger. It is the armiger who imbues the elements of their arms with personal meaning and representation! <:w_heraldry:758369750006104064>
