<:fridge:1006407778908250204> Often, people can be indecisive about their heraldic designs. To ensure that you are satisfied with your coat of arms, it's usually a great idea to "**fridge test**" it for a period of time. Traditionally, this means sticking the design on the fridge, but any place where you can see it regularly works, including:

- Your background image on your phone or PC
- A closet door
- Above your desk
- As a sticker somewhere

There's no set duration: people have done it for just a few days or as long as a few months. If you have multiple designs, fridge testing is also a great way to decide between them - you can stick them all up there and see which one you like the most after the testing period.
