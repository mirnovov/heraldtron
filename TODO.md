# Long term/later
- Make a 3.7 branch and try optimized Python implementations, such as Pyston, Nuitka, or PyPy
- Include new Discord features that dpy 2.0 supports, like possibly slash commands
- Translate into other languages for foreign heraldry servers (French, possibly German...)
- Add role react post function instead of using Dyno
