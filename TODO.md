- Implement DB stuff
	- Add auto blazon registration/GreiiN stuff
		- Create user profile thingies on command that are linked
		- Maybe add auto roll channel setup (might be helpful, as mods often get the perms slightly wrong)
	- Add roll channel autocategorisation/archiving
	- Make functionality currently unusable in DMs available where possible
	- Add proper mod authorisation and hide mod commands
