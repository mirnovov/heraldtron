#Before release

- Implement DB stuff
	- Add auto blazon registration/GreiiN stuff
		- Add generic user command
		- Add setemblazon command
		- Maybe add auto roll channel setup (might be helpful, as mods often get the perms slightly wrong)
	- Finish converters
	- Add roll channel autocategorisation/archiving
	- Make functionality currently unusable in DMs available where possible
	- Add proper mod authorisation and hide mod commands
	
	
#Long term/later
- Make a 3.7 branch and try optimized Python implementations, such as Pyston, Nuitka, or PyPy
