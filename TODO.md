- Implement DB (using SQLite)
	- Requires channel to be stored:
		- Add hello/goodbye messages (and allow mods to set their channel)
		- Log warnings
	- Add auto blazon registration/GreiiN stuff
		- Create user profile thingies on main server that are linked
		- Maybe add auto roll channel setup (might be helpful, as mods often get the perms slightly wrong)
	- Add roll channel autocategorisation/archiving
	- Make functionality currently unusable in DMs available where possible
	- Add resources lookup
	- Add proper mod authorisation and hide mod commands

- Add blazon generators (in #resources)
