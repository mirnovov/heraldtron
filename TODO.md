#Before release
- Implement DB stuff
	- Maybe add auto roll channel setup (might be helpful, as mods often get the perms slightly wrong)
	- Add roll channel autocategorisation/archiving
		- channel sorting behaviour from discord-ext-alternatives?
	- Make functionality currently unusable in DMs available where possible
	- Add proper mod authorisation (using _roles if viable for efficiency)

#Long term/later
- Make a 3.7 branch and try optimized Python implementations, such as Pyston, Nuitka, or PyPy
